Tuples
======
The `tuples` module defines generic operations for working with tuples. The routines defined in this module allow heterogeneous records to be manipulated as if they were homogeneous collections, while maintaining type safety.

Installation
------------
Install with [Nimble](https://github.com/nim-lang/nimble):

```
nimble install tuples
```

Usage
-----
Please refer to the documentation [here](http://www.vision.caltech.edu/~mmcgill/tuples.html).
